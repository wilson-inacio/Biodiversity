#### Overview
This project explores and analyzes the data composed of two files, species_info.csv and observations.csv, to acquire some insights about the conservation status of species encountered in four U.S.A. National Parks.<br>
With this analysis I intend to find out what the distribution of conservation status is for each individual species, what the category with the most endangered species is, which is at risk of getting more endangered species, and whether the differences between a species category and its conservation status are significant, among other insights.

Library dependencies used:
Python: 3.13.5<br>
Pandas: 2.3.2<br>
Numpy: 2.3.2<br>
Matplotlib: 3.10.6<br>
Seaborn: 0.13.2<br>
SciPy: 1.16.2

#### Project Objectives
- Import the necessary libraries to run the project and the files into two dataframes.
- Assess the integrity of the data and use summary statistics to get the general shape.
- Create visualizations to better understand the data.
- Used statistical inference to answer the question, "Are the differences between a species category and its conservation status statistically significant?"
- Create a slide deck.

#### Dataset
The data came in two files, species_info.csv and observations.csv, both obtained from [Codecademy'((https://www.codecademy.com)].

#### About the Dataset
The first file lists the scientific names of the species encountered, as well as the common names and the conservation status of said species. The second file lists the scientific names of the species, as well as the number of times observed and at which park.

#### Conclusion
The conclusion for this project is included at the end of the Jupyter notebook file.
